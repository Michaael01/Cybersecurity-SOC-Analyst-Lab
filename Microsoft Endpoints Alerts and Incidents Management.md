# Alerts and Incidents Management
An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that tell the story of an attack. Microsoft Defender XDR automatically aggregates malicious and suspicious events found in different device, user, and mailbox units on the network. Grouping related alerts into an incident gives security leaders a comprehensive view of an attack.
